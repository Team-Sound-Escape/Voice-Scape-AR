# Voice Scape AR 🎵✨  

Voice Scape AR is an immersive, **voice-driven augmented reality (AR) music experience** built for **Snap Spectacles**. Users can create **synthwave-inspired** music loops through **voice commands**, while **neon fractals and reactive visuals** dynamically appear in their real-world space. This hands-free approach allows for **real-time music visualization**, making **music creation more accessible and intuitive**.

## 🚀 Project Overview  

- **Core Innovation**: Hands-free **voice-controlled** music sequencer in AR.
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Voice Commands** to create and modify music.  
  - **FFT-based Real-Time Audio Visualization** (responsive fractals, neon animations).  
  - **Procedural Visuals** that evolve with user-generated soundscapes.  
  - **Spectacles Integration** for **spatially-aware music creation**.  
  - **Short & Replayable Sessions** (~10–15 minutes per play).  
  - **Unlockable loops, fractal styles, and shareable clips** for engagement.

## 📌 How It Works  

### 🔊 Voice-Driven Interaction  

Users **speak commands** to control the experience:  
- 🎵 **"Add Bassline"** → Introduces a synth bass layer.  
- 🥁 **"Change Drums"** → Replaces drum loops.  
- 🌌 **"Grow Fractals"** → Expands neon visuals.  
- 🎨 **"Change Colors"** → Alters the AR environment’s color palette.  

### 🎶 Real-Time Audio Visualization  

- **FFT-based** sound analysis maps music frequency to **fractal animations**.  
- **Neon fractals evolve dynamically**, reacting to **volume, beat intensity, and frequency range**.  
- **AR elements anchor in space**, enhancing immersion.

## 📍 User Flow  

1️⃣ **Lens Launch & Tutorial** (0–1 min)  
   - Quick guide explains **voice commands**.  
   - Users **select a starter synth loop** to begin creating.  

2️⃣ **Music Creation & Visual Expansion** (2–10 min)  
   - Users **layer tracks, change loops, and modify visuals** through voice.  
   - **Audio-reactive fractals and neon lights evolve dynamically** in AR.  

3️⃣ **Session Wrap-Up & Sharing** (10–12 min)  
   - Users see a **snapshot** of their final visual creation.  
   - Option to **save a clip** or **share via Snap**.  

4️⃣ **Replay & Retention Hooks** (12–15 min)  
   - Unlock **new color themes, sound loops, fractal effects** by returning for future sessions.
